## Cleaning up a commit

My Home Assistant commits have been in Bitbucket because of the privacy of dealing with secrets and API tokens. Most of the commit history included passwords, so I decided to just wipe the commit history. 

I use this gist [here](https://gist.github.com/git-zombie/ae312e4ba24c6ad8a527788e96ad4866) to clean it all up and I think I'm ready to port my Home Assistant code over to Github.
