title: I'm up and running!

A good colleague, Matt A., recommended that I check out Jekyll on Github pages instead of trying to run my own Wordpress blog or using one of the free WP hosting providers. I think I like this! I've moved my current 3-4 blog posts over here and will continue posting here. I'm shutting down the WP blog now.

I have a variety of side projects burning a hole in my mind that I'll probably end up documenting here: 
 - move some container projects from bitbucket to github(requires scrubbing commits for secrets)
 - maybe implement git-secret for a couple so that I can actually capture some of those secrets
 - maybe use Travis CI for deploying HASS
 - Ubuntu Core Snaps project for the new RPi 3B+
 - home automation goofiness

Stay tuned for more!
