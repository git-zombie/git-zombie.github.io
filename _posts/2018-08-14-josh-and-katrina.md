I wouldn't normally post on a human interest story like this, but this story hit me harder than most news stories. As a lawyer, I usually defend the justice system; in this case, I felt like this was a tragic story that could have been prevented. 

If you have the stomach, please [read the news article](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2018/04/02/new-details-emerge-phoenix-home-invasion-murder-arson/478507002/).

If you don't, suffice it to say that this woman hid under her bed while her husband was murdered. The guilty party(I don't think he deserves to be called a suspect) committed a host of crimes that night and in the years prior, having previously been ruled that he was incompetent to stand trial.

He had multiple convictions in NC, but the murder happened 24 minutes from where my sister, her husband, and my nephew live in AZ. She is 2 years younger than me and her husband was my sister's age; they were married 3 years. Neighbors said he was a cool guy and into woodworking and British cars.

If you have the heart, please consider donating to the family's [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/joshandkatrina) so she can take her husband's ashes to the places they wanted to visit before his life was tragically cut short. If you don't, try to look at [their wedding pictures](http://www.jenniferricephotography.com/blog/smith-fitzpatrick-wedding/2014/11/7) and then tell me if this story doesn't break your heart.
