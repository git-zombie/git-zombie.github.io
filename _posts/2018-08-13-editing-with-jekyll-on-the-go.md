#A decent solution for posting to this blog when traveling

One of the reasons I haven't been posting as much is due to the difficulty of posting on mobile. 

I think I've figured it out with the help of [Prose.io](https://prose.io/).

It seems as if all the good Jekyll editors for both Android and even desktop Windows stopped development back in 2016. Kinda disappointing, and I'm not sure why, frankly, but it is what it is. 

For now, I think I'll write my drafts in a markdown editor and then post via Prose.io. 

I had tried Prose before to little luck but on second pass, it seems like the trick is to change your [_config.yml](https://github.com/git-zombie/git-zombie.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) to setup a bit of the yaml matter and then you don't have to futz with the metadata in Prose, and it also helps simplify the image uploading.

If this post goes live, it will be the first content post that goes live using this methodology.

It will be particularly helpful when I go to Cuba next month, where the internet connections might be more intermittent than I'm used to. If it works for that trip, in the future I might move the content that normally goes to my Twitter feed here.
